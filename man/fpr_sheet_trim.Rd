\title{Trim up an excel worksheet - usually during import}
\usage{
fpr_sheet_trim(
  dat,
  col_filter_na = FALSE,
  col_filter_na_num = 2,
  row_empty_remove = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Dataframe}

\item{col_filter_na}{Logical whether to remove rows if `NA` is present in a specified column. Defaults to false.}

\item{col_filter_na_num}{Integer specifying column to filter if `NA`s are present. Defaults to 2 because
we use that in the fish submission form since `gazetted_name` is required and because first column
of location sheet (`step_1_ref_and_loc_info') is populated to row 1500 out of box. Note that this !is.na for col 2 results in some
trimming of a couple events on the admin_only_pick_lists.csv}

\item{row_empty_remove}{Logical on whether to remove empty dataframe rows until the first complete one is found in
order to select as rownames.  Needs to be turned on for `fpr_import_hab_con` to work.}
}
\value{
A dataframe
}
\description{
Select column names based on first row with inputs all across.
Trim up the dataframe based on whether there are events in the first column.
This is a `date` in the pscis inputs and `reference_number` in the fish submission template
}
